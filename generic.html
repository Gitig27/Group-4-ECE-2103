										<h1>Why Dredging?</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pansipit.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>In our study, we focused on the Pansipit River, located in the municipality of Lemery, Batangas, Philippines. We observed that the main environmental issue affecting the river is water pollution caused by untreated sewage being released into rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water from homes and commercial establishments. This pollution significantly impacts the river’s water quality, the surrounding ecosystem, and the health of the communities living nearby.</p>
									<p>For us in Lemery, Batangas, this issue hits close to home since the Pansipit River is a vital waterway for our town. It also serves as the only drainage outlet of Taal Lake, which is a crucial source of livelihood for many residents. The contamination of the river not only poses health risks by spreading diseases to local people but also harms the biodiversity of the river. This degradation negatively affects fishermen's livelihoods and undermines the overall health of the ecosystem.</p>
									<p>Knowing all of this, we believe that advocating for dredging is the best way to address the pollution in the Pansipit River. Dredging will remove accumulated waste and pollutants, improving water quality and restoring the river’s natural flow. This will benefit the ecosystem, support local fishermen’s livelihoods, and reduce the health risks posed by contamination. By combining dredging with better waste management practices, we can create a lasting solution for our community and the environment.</p>
